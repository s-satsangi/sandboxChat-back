# YACApp backend

Hey! this repo, sandboxChat-back, is a backend I'm using to play around with some technologies and learn a bit about programming principles.

As of today, technologies in play on the backend are node.js, socket.io & express. the [frontend](https://github.com/s-satsangi/sandboxChat-front) is react using socket.io.

# Upcoming features to incorporate:

-Create a responsive design that translates well to phones. Clean up the desktop design.
-Implement redux for state management.
-Implement private chats.
-Create a group list that users can use to travel between open channels.
-Implement an onClick() handler on user names to private chat, on group names to switch between groups.
-Implement passwords.
